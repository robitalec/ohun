\title{Summarize detection diagnostics}
\usage{
summarize_diagnostic(diagnostic, time.diagnostics = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{diagnostic}{A data frame with the reference selections (start and end of the sound events) that will be used to evaluate the performance of the detection, represented by those selections in 'detection'. Must contained at least the following columns: "sound.files", "selec", "start" and "end".}

\item{time.diagnostics}{Logical argument to control if diagnostics related to the duration of the sound events ("mean.duration.true.positives", "mean.duration.false.positives", "mean.duration.false.negatives" and "proportional.duration.true.positives") are returned (if \code{TRUE}). Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame, typically the output of a detection optimization function (\code{\link{diagnose_detection}}, \code{\link{optimize_energy_detector}}, \code{\link{optimize_template_detector}}) including the following detection performance diagnostics:
\itemize{
 \item \code{true.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that correspond to any detection. Matching is defined as some degree of overlap in time. In a perfect detection routine it should be equal to the number of rows in 'reference'.
 \item \code{false.positives}: number of detections that don't match any of the sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{false.negatives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were not detected (not found in 'detection'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{split.positives}: number of sound events in 'reference' that were overlapped by more than 1 detection (i.e. detections that were split). In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{merged.positives}: number of sound events in 'detection' that were overlapped by more than 1 detection (i.e. sound events that were merged). In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
 \item \code{mean.duration.true.positives}: mean duration of true positives (in s). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{mean.duration.false.positives}: mean duration of false positives (in s). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{mean.duration.false.negatives}: mean duration of false negatives (in s). Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{overlap.to.true.positives}: ratio of the time overlap of true positives in 'detection' with its corresponding reference sound event to the duration of the reference sound event.
 \item \code{proportional.duration.true.positives}: ratio of duration of true positives to th duration of sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1. Based only on true positives that were not split or merged. Only included when \code{time.diagnostics = TRUE}.
 \item \code{recall}: Proportion of sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
 \item \code{precision}: Proportion of detections that correspond to sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
 \item \code{f1.score}: Combines recall and precision as the harmonic mean of these two. Provides a single value for evaluating performance. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.

\description{
\code{summarize_diagnostic} summarizes detection diagnostics
}
\details{
The function summarizes a detection diagnostic data frame in which diagnostic parameters are shown split by (typically) a categorical column, usually sound files. This function is used internally by \code{\link{diagnose_detection}}.
}
\examples{
{
# load example selection tables

data("lbh_reference")

# run diagnose_detection() by sound file
diag <- diagnose_detection(reference = lbh_reference,
detection = lbh_reference[-1, ], by.sound.file = TRUE)

# summarize
summarize_diagnostic(diagnostic = diag)

# should be the same as this:
diagnose_detection(reference = lbh_reference,
detection = lbh_reference[-1, ], by.sound.file = FALSE)
}
